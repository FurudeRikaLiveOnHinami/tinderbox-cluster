=============================
Gentoo OpenStack Build System
=============================

This is a POC
We are useing OpenStack's libs and nova as code base.
https://github.com/openstack/nova
For the building and populate the db we use portage's api.

Thanks to the community of thos team's.

The code for now need alot of work.
We need to cleanout not needed Nova code.
Most of the code to populate the db is done.
The code for the build worker neeed to be done.
